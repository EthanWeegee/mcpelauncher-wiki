Troubleshooting
===============

.. contents:: :local:

Appimage
--------

Appimage crashes when I try to sign in to Google
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The current workaround is to use LD_PRELOAD for nss3.
On deb based distros you should run :code:`LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libnss3.so ./Minecraft_Bedrock_Launcher.AppImage` 

Everywhere else, such as on rpm based distros, you should run :code:`LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libnss3.so ./Minecraft_Bedrock_Launcher.AppImage`

Make sure you the :code:`libnss3` package installed.

Controller
----------

The player's view drifts by itself when a controller is plugged in
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This happens when the controller's Deadzones are not set properly for the game. You must manually set the deadzones for your controller.

- Linux: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Gamepad#evdev_API_deadzones or if you have an Xbox360 Controller, open a terminal and run :code:`sudo xboxdrv --detach-kernel-driver --deadzone 6000 --silent --type xbox360 --mimic-xpad` while you are **ingame**.

- Mac OS X: TBA

Game launcher
-------------

Graphics performance issues (software rendering) - :code:`EGLUT: failed to initialize EGL display...`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If the game is running poorly, it might be using software rendering (identified by the :code:`llvmpipe` string in the renderer). If you have been redirected here by a link in the launcher this is the case.

You should make sure to install the proper 32-bit graphic drivers for your hardware.

- For integrated graphics and most AMD GPUs (and maybe Nvidia on nouveau) - :code:`sudo apt-get install libegl1-mesa:i386 libegl1-mesa-drivers:i386`

You may need to reinstall the proprietary drivers if you had installed them manually before.

MSA daemon could not be found
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Make sure you have properly installed the following packages: :code:`msa-daemon msa-ui-qt`
If compiling from sources, make sure to install the MSA component.

No audio
~~~~~~~~
- **Ubuntu:** Make sure :code:`libasound2:i386` is installed. If it is, you may need to install :code:`libpulse0:i386`.
- **Arch:** Make sure :code:`lib32-libpulse` and :code:`lib32-alsa-plugins` are installed on your system.
- **Other distros:** Make sure to install alsa (asound) and/or pulseaudio depending on your system configuration.

**Please note that the in-game Music is downloaded separately as a free item in the Marketplace.**

.. _updating_the_launcher:

Updating the launcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Depending on your system the process may vary:

- Ubuntu prebuilt packages - :code:`sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade`

- Mac OS - Redownload the package

macOS X Catalina - :code:`Could not find the game launcher..`
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Currently, macOS Catalina does not support 32-bit applications at this time; you will not be able to use this launcher.
There are some solutions, you can:

- Downgrade to Mojave

- Find a suitable Linux Distro (anything Ubuntu-based will be the easiest)

File picking doesn't work or crashes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
You need to install the :code:`zenity` utility:

- Ubuntu - :code:`sudo apt-get install zenity`

I compiled and/or installed everything, but :code:`mcpelauncher-client` doesn't start
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Chances are, you don't have the actual game yet. This project does **not** provide MCPE/Minecraft Bedrock Edition itself.

The easiest way to download and start the game is through the graphical Qt UI (:code:`mcpelauncher-ui-qt`, sometimes called metalauncher). This requires to log into a Google Play Account with Minecraft purchased.

Otherwise, obtain a valid Minecraft x86 :code:`.apk` file and use the :ref:`extract utility <extractor>`.

I Used the Qt UI (metalauncher) to download the game, but :code:`mcpelauncher-client` still doesn't work
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To start a given version of Minecraft you can run :code:`mcpelauncher-client` with the :code:`-dg` argument, eg. :code:`mcpelauncher-client -dg ~/.local/share/mcpelauncher/versions/DESIRED_VERSION`.

:code:`ls ~/.local/share/mcpelauncher/versions/` will list all versions you have installed.

I run into lagspikes during PvP
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This can be fixed by starting the game manually via the command line. To do this, open a terminal and run the following:

Linux:

- :code:`mcpelauncher-client -dg ~/.local/share/mcpelauncher/versions/1.2.3.4` - Replace 1.2.3.4 with the version of Minecraft you want to run.

Mac OS X:

- :code:`cd /Applications/Minecraft\ Bedrock\ Launcher.app/Contents/MacOS`

- :code:`./mcpelauncher-client -dg ~/Library/Application\ Support/mcpelauncher/versions/1.2.3.4` - Replace 1.2.3.4 with the version of Minecraft you want to run.

Qt launcher UI
--------------

Running the troubleshooter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Click the gear icon (settings) in the top right corner of the Qt launcher window, and press the [Run troubleshooter] button.

Could not find the game launcher
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This may happen when the game launcher has not been installed or set properly. The launcher (mcpelauncher-client) must be available in the PATH variable for the launcher to work.
If you are compiling from sources and do not want to install the launcher, please set the GAME_LAUNCHER_PATH at compile time with cmake (eg. :code:`cmake -DGAME_LAUNCHER_PATH-/home/paul/mcpelauncher/build/mcpelauncher-client ..`, make sure that this is the path to the directory containing the binary, and not the binary itself). Otherwise make sure the launcher is properly installed in your system.

The launcher crashes when I press Download and Play
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
First of all, make sure a version name is displayed under the Download and Play button. If it's not, please wait some time and/or try restarting the launcher. A window asking you to accept Google Play TOS should appear first.

If the launcher still fails to download, it's possible you are trying to download a beta version of the game. Make sure to register in the beta first at https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.mojang.minecraftpe.

**You must have purchased Minecraft on the account you're trying to use.**

In some cases, you may need to :ref:`clear the launcher data <clearing_the_launcher_ui_data>`.

.. _clearing_the_launcher_ui_data:

Clearing the launcher UI data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the following commands:

.. code:: bash

   rm -rf ~/.config/Minecraft\ Linux\ Launcher
   rm -rf ~/.local/share/Minecraft\ Linux\ Launcher
   rm -rf ~/.cache/Minecraft\ Linux\ Launcher

Obtaining the game log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In order to be able to view the game log, in the launcher press the gear in the top right corner and check the "Show log when starting the game" option. This will show a log and update it in realtime. You can copy it by pressing the icon in the top-right corner of the log window.
Additionally, the log will be shown if the game crashes.
